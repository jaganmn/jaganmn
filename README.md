### Hey, I'm Mikael!

I'm a research software developer based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada,
currently freelancing but generally looking for a new full time job.
Feel free to [send me an e-mail](mailto:jaganmn2@gmail.com).

In my free time, I contribute to the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/)
and to the R package ecosystem maintained by [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
and [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/).

* [Since 2021](https://bugs.r-project.org/buglist.cgi?email3=jaganmn%40mcmaster.ca&emaillongdesc3=1&emailtype3=substring&list_id=44997&order=bug_id%20DESC&query_format=advanced),
  I've been providing patches for bugs in R, with a focus on numerical
  linear algebra, statistical models, and object orientation (generic
  functions, classes, methods, and method dispatch).

* I'm co-leading a [£500k grant](https://www.software.ac.uk/rsmf-round-1-projects)
  from the Research Software Maintenance Fund of the UK's Software
  Sustainability Institute.  During 2026-2027, I'll be collaborating
  with members of the R Core Team on infrastructure to help sustain
  the R Project.

* I maintain R package [**Matrix**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Matrix)
  alongside R Core Team member (and principal maintainer) Martin
  Mächler.  **Matrix** extends R with classes and methods for
  representing and operating on dense and sparse structured matrices.
  **Matrix** is a "recommended" package, meaning that it is bundled
  with standard distributions of R and therefore available "out of the
  box" to almost all R users.  More than 2000 packages distributed by
  CRAN or Bioconductor list **Matrix** as a direct dependency.

* I maintain R package [**flint**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=flint),
  an R interface to C library [FLINT](https://github.com/flintlib/flint).
  **flint** extends R with arbitrary precision integer and
  floating-point types and arbitrary precision implementations of
  basic arithmetic, numerical linear algebra and integration, special
  mathematical functions, and ODE system solution.  Numerical error is
  propagated rigorously using so-called
  [midpoint-radius interval arithmetic](https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2017.2690633).

* I contribute to a stack of R packages widely used for estimation of
  [generalized linear mixed effects models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_model),
  including [**lme4**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lme4) (as a
  co-author) and [**glmmTMB**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=glmmTMB).

Many of my projects can be viewed as providing an R API for internal
or system C and C++ libraries.  *Maintaining* such software (testing
that it works correctly across toolchains, platforms, environments,
...), one becomes familiar with all sorts of non-R stuff (programming
languages, libraries, tools, ..., also *people skills*), but I don't
enumerate these here. :-)
